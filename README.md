![Main](./src/images/projects/portfolio.png)

## Introduction

This is my Portfolio, in it you will find all my personal projects as well as details about them, links to demos, source code, my biography or my curriculum. The page has been translated into 4 languages, since it has been developed expressly to collaborate in my sister's Bachelor's Degree Final Project on technological translations.

You can run the deployed project here: https://dianamoreno.netlify.app

## Features

- This is a multi-language website: English, Spanish, Catalan and German.
- Translations provided by Yolanda Moreno.
- The design is based on a single page showing my biography, my projects and contact details.
- My curriculum can be downloaded in all four languages.
- Each of the projects shows information about what features it has, what I learned in developing it, links to the source code and a demo.
- You can contact me by filling out the form in the contact section or else by mail or social networks."

## What I learned?

- How to prepare a project to be translated into four languages.
- How to dynamically generate pages through a template.

- How to select the active menu section when scrolling through the page using the Intersection Observer.
